what i learned:

1. % 10 is to collect the numbers in the end of the int, / is to remove numbers

2. default value of nullptr, use of strstr function

3. passing reference values, and accessing values from it

4. what an array pointer is, never seen one, or don't remember what it is

5. using pointers as a shortcut to reroute values

6. sorting the proper way using pointers, unlike what i did for project 2 in ipc where i used my less efficient sorting logic

difficulties:

- i got guidance from my friend in a different section, not gonna lie he carried me for the first workshop

feedback:

1. fardad's instructions compared to kathy's is wayyyyy unclear. idk if it's because the lack of using ai, or too much use of it. it was entirely a fever-dream for me, idk what i was doing most of the time.

2. the amount of work it took for workshop 1 is too much. i can see how students with no coding experience fail this class from the first week. you are already bombarded with headaches first week.

3. oop workshop 1 is roughly the length of ipc project 1. you're only given 1 week to do a whole project, with very little guidance.

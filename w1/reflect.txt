1. fardad's instructions compared to kathy's is wayyyyy unclear. idk if it's because the lack of using ai, or too much use of it. it was entirely a fever-dream for me, idk what i was doing most of the time.
2. the amount of work it took for workshop 1 is too much. i can see how students with no coding experience fail this class from the first week. you are already bombarded with headaches first week.
3. oop workshop 1 is roughly the length of ipc project 1. you're only given 1 week to do a whole project, with very little guidance.
4. honestly, you are really good at explaining the theoretical concepts and preparing students for the bi-weekly quizzes. because of that, most of the time is spent on the slide deck rather than a lecture doing it practically.
5. i would appreciate it if you could demonstrate certain sections of the weekly workshops instead of having time wasted on bi-weekly quizzes. accounting does it with 2 regular exams, 1 midterm, and 1 final, with profs .
